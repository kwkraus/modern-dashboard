# Contracts: Settings Dialog Modal

No external API or persistence interactions in this phase.

The settings dialog operates entirely on ephemeral client-side state. Future phases may introduce:
- Preference persistence endpoint (e.g., PATCH /user/preferences)
- Feature flag exposure service

At that time an OpenAPI document will be added here.
